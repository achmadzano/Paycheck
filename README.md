## Getting Started

Welcome to the exciting journey of getting started with Paycheck! Follow these simple steps to set the stage for a successful development experience:

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/achmadzano/Paycheck.git
```
2. Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Composer:
```
git clone https://github.com/achmadzano/Paycheck.git
```
3. Create a copy of your .env file
.env files are not generally committed to source control for security reasons. But there is a .env.example which is a template of the .env file that the project expects us to have. So we will make a copy of the .env.example file and create a .env file that we can start to fill out to do things like database configuration in the next few steps.
```
cp .env.example .env
```
4. Generate Application Key:

Generate a unique application key using the following Artisan command:
```
php artisan key:generate
```
5. Database Migration:

Run database migrations to create the necessary tables in your database:
```
php artisan migrate
```
6. Start the Development Server:

Launch the Laravel development server with the following command:
```
php artisan serve
```
